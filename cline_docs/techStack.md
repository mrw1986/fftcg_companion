# Technology Stack

## Frontend Framework

### Flutter

- Primary UI framework
- Cross-platform development
- Material Design components
- Efficient widget rebuilding

### State Management

- Riverpod for dependency injection and state management
  - AsyncNotifierProvider for async operations
  - StateNotifierProvider for mutable state
  - Provider for dependency injection
  - ConsumerWidget for reactive UI updates

### UI/UX Components

- flutter_native_splash for branded launch screen
- Shared loading indicators
- Page-level loading states
- Error handling components

## Backend Services

### Firebase

- Cloud Firestore for card database
  - Real-time updates
  - Offline persistence
  - Complex querying capabilities
- Firebase Storage for card images
- Firebase Authentication (planned)

### Local Storage

- Hive for local caching
  - Card data caching
  - Search results caching
  - User preferences
  - Custom adapters for complex types

## Architecture

### Project Structure
