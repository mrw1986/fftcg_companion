# Technology Stack

## Frontend Framework

### Flutter

- Primary UI framework
- Cross-platform development
- Material Design components
- Efficient widget rebuilding

### State Management

- Riverpod for dependency injection and state management
  - AsyncNotifierProvider for async operations
  - StateNotifierProvider for mutable state
  - Provider for dependency injection
  - ConsumerWidget for reactive UI updates

## Backend Services

### Firebase

- Cloud Firestore for card database
  - Real-time updates
  - Offline persistence
  - Complex querying capabilities
- Firebase Storage for card images
- Firebase Authentication (planned)

### Local Storage

- Hive for local caching
  - Card data caching
  - Search results caching
  - User preferences
  - Custom adapters for complex types

## Architecture

### Project Structure

- Feature-first architecture
  - Separate modules by feature
  - Shared core functionality
  - Clear separation of concerns

### Design Patterns

- Repository pattern for data access
- Provider pattern for dependency injection
- MVVM-inspired presentation layer
- Clean Architecture principles

### Data Flow

- Unidirectional data flow
- Immutable state management
- Reactive programming with Streams
- Async/await for asynchronous operations

## Development Tools

### Code Generation

- build_runner for code generation
- freezed for immutable models
- riverpod_generator for provider generation

### Testing

- Unit tests with Flutter Test
- Widget tests for UI components
- Integration tests (planned)

## Performance Optimizations

### Image Loading

- Cached network images
- Progressive image loading
- Memory-efficient image caching

### Data Management

- Efficient filtering algorithms
- Local caching for offline access
- Lazy loading for large datasets

## Future Considerations

### Planned Additions

- Camera integration for card scanning
- Price tracking APIs
- User authentication
- Cloud synchronization

### Scalability

- Modular architecture for easy expansion
- Efficient data structures
- Performance monitoring
- Error tracking and analytics
