# Current Task

## Current Objective 40: Prevent Anonymous Dialog After Password Reset

### Context

After initiating a password reset, authenticated users were logged out (for security) but then immediately shown the "Account Limits" dialog intended for new anonymous users. This was confusing as the user was managing their existing account.

### Changes Made

1. Modified `AuthService.signOut`:
    * Added an optional boolean parameter `skipAccountLimitsDialog` (default: `false`).
    * If `skipAccountLimitsDialog` is `true`, the method now skips resetting the `last_limits_dialog_shown` timestamp in Hive storage.
2. Updated `reset_password_page.dart`:
    * Modified the `_sendPasswordResetEmail` function.
    * The call to `signOut` (which happens only if the user was authenticated) now passes `skipAccountLimitsDialog: true`.

### Result

Authenticated users who reset their password will still be logged out for security, but they will no longer see the "Account Limits" dialog immediately afterward, providing a less confusing user experience.

### Testing Required

1. Log in with an existing Email/Password account.
2. Navigate to the Reset Password page (e.g., via Account Settings).
3. Initiate the password reset for the logged-in user's email.
4. Confirm the success SnackBar appears ("...You have been logged out...").
5. **Confirm the "Account Limits" dialog does *not* appear.**
6. Confirm the user is logged out and potentially redirected to the login page or shown an anonymous state UI.

## Previous Objectives (Completed)

1. **Fix Email Verification Status Update (Objective 39)**
    * **Context:** The application wasn't consistently updating the `isVerified` field in Firestore when users verified their email.
    * **Changes Made:** Modified `email_verification_checker.dart` to stop timer on verification and pass verified `User` to `AuthService.handleEmailVerificationComplete`. Updated `AuthService` method to accept the `User` object.
    * **Result:** Ensured Firestore `isVerified` field updates reliably using confirmed verified user state.

2. **Fix Authentication Flow and Firestore Data Issues (Objective 38)**
    * **Context:** Changes during registration routing fix (Objective 36) caused issues with user document creation happening in multiple places (AuthService, RegisterPage).
    * **Goal:** Centralize user document creation in AuthService and ensure proper order of operations.
    * **Status:** This objective is superseded by ongoing reviews and fixes but remains relevant context. The core issue of centralizing user creation still needs verification.
    * **Next Steps (Deferred/Ongoing):** Review AuthService/RegisterPage calls to UserRepository, ensure AuthService handles all creation/updates.

3. **Fix Registration Routing Error (Objective 36)**
    * **Context:** A `GoException: no routes for location: /profile/account-settings` error occurred after registration.
    * **Analysis:** Reviewed `app_router.dart` and found the correct path for `AccountSettingsPage` is `/profile/account`. Reviewed `register_page.dart` and found three instances where `context.go('/profile/account-settings')` was used incorrectly.
    * **Changes Made:** Corrected the navigation paths in `register_page.dart` to use `context.go('/profile/account')` in the `_registerWithEmailAndPassword` and `_signInWithGoogle` methods.
    * **Conclusion:** The navigation path after registration is now correct.

4. **Update Registration Confirmation Text (Objective 35)**
    * **Context:** The confirmation message after email/password registration was misleading.
    * **Changes Made:** Updated the confirmation dialog text in `register_page.dart` to accurately state the user is signed in but unverified with limited capabilities.
    * **Conclusion:** Registration confirmation text is now consistent and accurate.

5. **Correct Account Deletion Order (Objective 34)**
    * Modified `AuthService.deleteUser` to delete Auth user first, then Firestore data.
    * Confirmed UI handles re-authentication correctly before calling `deleteUser`.
    * Updated documentation.

6. **Ensure Firestore User Document is Fully Populated During Authentication (Objective 33)**
    * Analyzed `UserModel`, `UserRepository`, `AuthService`, and `firestore.rules`.
    * Confirmed existing implementation correctly populates/updates user documents.
    * Refined `firestore.rules` to prevent `createdAt` updates.
    * Recommended testing.

7. **Fixed Registration Navigation (Objective 32)**
    * Ensured users are navigated to the Account Settings page after email/password and Google registration/linking. *(Note: This objective was marked complete previously, but the routing error indicated it wasn't fully resolved until Objective 36)*

8. **Fixed Account Limits Dialog Issue After Google Sign-In (Objective 31)**
    * Prevented the Account Limits dialog from appearing after cancelling Google sign-in or linking by using an `isInternalAuthFlow` flag.

9. **Fixed Google Authentication Display Name Issue (Objective 30)**
    * Ensured Google display name is correctly extracted and stored in Firestore user document.

10. **Improve Email Verification UI and Profile Page Aesthetics (Objective 28)**
    * Updated `ProfilePage` and `AccountSettingsPage` for better UI/UX for unverified users.

11. **Data Migration and Firestore Rules Updates (Objective 27 - Fix Applied)**
    * Updated `firestore.rules` to allow `collectionCount` updates correctly.
    * Updated `UserRepository.createUserFromAuth` to initialize `collectionCount: 0` on new user creation.
    * Updated `AuthService.linkGoogleToAnonymous` to create user doc *after* sign-in.
    * **Testing Still Required:** Verify fixes by testing anonymous sign-in, account deletion, and anonymous-to-Google linking flows.

12. **Fixed Email Update Flow and UI Updates (Objective 26)**
    * Fixed UI not updating after linking Google authentication.
    * Improved email update messaging based on auth methods.

13. **Fixed Authentication State & UI Issues (Objective 26 - Ongoing Testing)**
    * Implemented security enhancements (limits, grace period, dialog).
    * Fixed various UI and state management issues related to auth methods, linking, deletion, and data migration.

14. **Authentication System Rebuild**
    * Completed full rebuild of authentication system.
