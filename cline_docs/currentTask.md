Improve Authentication Security and Code Quality

### Authentication Context

The authentication service needed improvements to follow Firebase's latest security best practices and enhance code quality:

1. The service was using deprecated methods that could expose email enumeration vulnerabilities
2. There was unused code and unnecessary dependencies
3. Error handling could be improved for better user experience

### Authentication Implementation Plan

1. Security Improvements:
   - Remove deprecated fetchSignInMethodsForEmail method
   - Implement more secure error handling
   - Update error messages to maintain security while being user-friendly

2. Code Quality:
   - Remove unused _ref field from AuthService
   - Update AuthService constructor
   - Fix provider initialization
   - Maintain all existing functionality

3. Error Handling:
   - Enhance error messages for all scenarios
   - Improve user feedback
   - Add better error logging

### Authentication Implementation Results

#### Testing Strategy

1. Authentication Flow Tests:
   - Email/password sign-in
   - Google sign-in
   - Anonymous authentication
   - Account linking
   - Error handling for each flow

2. Security Tests:
   - Email enumeration prevention
   - Proper error message security
   - Credential validation
   - Token handling

3. Error Handling Tests:
