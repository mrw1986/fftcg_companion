# Current Task

## Current Objective: Fix Account Settings UI Update After Linking

### Context

- **Issue:** The "Change Password" option in `AccountSettingsPage` does not appear immediately after a user creates an account with email/password or links email/password to an existing account (e.g., Google). This happens because the `User` object passed to the UI (`AccountInfoCard`) doesn't reflect the updated `providerData` immediately after the linking operation.
- **Investigation:** Reviewed `AccountSettingsPage` and `AccountInfoCard`. Confirmed the UI relies on `user.providerData` to determine if the 'password' provider exists. The timing of the `User` object update after linking was identified as the likely cause. Logs confirmed user reload and provider invalidation were happening, but the UI still didn't update immediately.
- **Previous Focus:** Extensive work on authentication flows, including refactoring `authNotifierProvider`, fixing redirects, and managing email verification/update states.

### Actions Taken So Far

- Reviewed `projectRoadmap.md`, `currentTask.md`, `techStack.md`, and `codebaseSummary.md`.
- Read `lib/features/profile/presentation/pages/account_settings_page.dart`.
- Read `lib/features/profile/presentation/widgets/account_info_card.dart`.
- **Attempt 1 Fix:** Modified `_linkWithGoogle` and `_linkWithEmailPassword` in `lib/features/profile/presentation/pages/account_settings_page.dart` to include `FirebaseAuth.instance.currentUser?.reload()` followed by `ref.invalidate(authNotifierProvider)`. This did not fully resolve the issue.
- **Attempt 2 Fix:** Modified `lib/features/profile/presentation/pages/account_settings_page.dart` to rely solely on `authState.user` for the user object and added a delayed `setState` after linking operations. Also removed an erroneous error handling block. This also did not fully resolve the issue.
- **Attempt 3 Fix:** Converted `lib/features/profile/presentation/widgets/account_info_card.dart` back to a `ConsumerWidget` to directly watch `authNotifierProvider` and get the `User` object. Removed the `user` parameter from `AccountInfoCard`. Modified `lib/features/profile/presentation/pages/account_settings_page.dart` to remove the `user` parameter from the `AccountInfoCard` constructor call and removed the erroneous error handling block.

### Next Steps

- **Test the fix:** Verify that the "Change Password" option now appears immediately in the `AccountSettingsPage` after:
  - Creating a new account using Email/Password.
  - Linking Email/Password to an existing Google account.
- Update `codebaseSummary.md` with the changes made.
- Conclude the task.

### Status

- **Completed:** Analysis of the UI update issue.
- **Completed:** Implementation of the fix (AccountInfoCard as ConsumerWidget, direct provider watch) in `account_info_card.dart` and `account_settings_page.dart`.
- **Pending:** Testing the fix.
- **Pending:** Update `codebaseSummary.md`.

## Previous Objectives (Completed)

### Test Email Change Flow & General Auth (Previous Session - Attempt 1)

#### Context (Reauthentication & Sign-in Redirect Issues)

- A major refactoring of `lib/core/providers/auth_provider.dart` was completed to use `AsyncNotifier` (`authNotifierProvider`).
- **Issue Found During Testing:** After changing the email address using `verifyBeforeUpdateEmail` and verifying the new email via the link, the app UI did not update correctly.
- **Fix Implemented:** Modified `AuthNotifier` (`lib/core/providers/auth_provider.dart`) to explicitly call `user.reload()` before processing user data in its listener. Added app lifecycle checks in `AccountSettingsPage` to handle updates when the app resumes. Added `emailUpdateNotifierProvider` and `originalEmailForUpdateCheckProvider` to manage pending/original email states.
- **Decision:** Proceed with testing the "stay logged in" approach for email updates, verifying the implemented fixes.
- **Logging Verified:** Confirmed sufficient logging exists in `AccountSettingsPage`, `AuthService`, and `AuthNotifier` to diagnose the flow.
- **Additional Issues Investigated:** User reported a blank reauthentication screen and getting stuck on the sign-in page after Google sign-in.

#### Actions Taken (Reauthentication & Sign-in Redirect)

- Refactored `lib/core/providers/auth_provider.dart` to use `AsyncNotifier`.
- Updated all dependent files to use `authNotifierProvider`.
- Implemented `user.reload()` fix in `AuthNotifier`.
- Added app lifecycle checks in `AccountSettingsPage`.
- Added providers for pending/original email state management.
- Verified logging across relevant files.
- **Investigated Reauthentication/Sign-in Issues:**
  - Added diagnostic logging to `ProfileReauthDialog` to check provider loading.
  - Added diagnostic logging to `AuthNotifier` to check router listener notification and redirect logic execution.
  - Confirmed via logs that the router listener *is* being called and the `redirect` function *is* executed correctly after Google sign-in.
  - The blank reauthentication screen could not be reproduced during the investigation.
  - Removed diagnostic logging after confirming correct behavior.

#### Current Status

- **Completed:** Auth provider refactoring.
- **Completed:** Implementation of fixes for the "stay logged in" email update flow (reload, lifecycle checks, state providers).
- **Completed:** Verification of logging sufficiency.
- **Completed:** Update of testing instructions (`userInstructions/testAuthFlows.md`).
- **Completed:** Investigation of reauthentication/sign-in redirect issues (issues appear resolved/intermittent).
- **Completed:** Execution of the authentication testing plan.

### Investigate Reauthentication & Sign-in Redirect Issues (Previous Session - Attempt 1)

#### Investigation Context

- User reported two issues:
  1. A blank screen appearing when reauthentication was required (e.g., before account deletion), with no options (Google/Email) shown.
  2. After signing in with Google, the UI remained stuck on the sign-in page despite logs indicating successful authentication.

#### Actions Taken

1. **Diagnose Reauth Screen:**
    - Added detailed logging to `_loadProviders` in `ProfileReauthDialog` to check `FirebaseAuth.instance.currentUser` and provider data access.
    - Attempted to reproduce the blank screen by triggering reauthentication (e.g., via account deletion flow).
    - **Finding:** The blank screen issue could not be reproduced. Reauthentication was not required during testing due to a recent session.
2. **Diagnose Sign-in Redirect:**
    - Observed logs showing successful Google sign-in (`AuthStatus.authenticated`) but no subsequent router redirect checks.
    - Added logging around `_routerListener?.call()` in `AuthNotifier` to confirm listener notification.
    - Added logging at the start of the `AuthNotifier.redirect` method to confirm its execution.
    - Tested Google sign-in again.
    - **Finding:** Logs confirmed the router listener *was* called and the `redirect` function *was* executed correctly, redirecting from `/auth` to `/` as expected. The issue of getting stuck seemed intermittent or resolved by app restart/rebuild.
3. **Cleanup:** Removed the added diagnostic logging from `ProfileReauthDialog` and `AuthNotifier`.

#### Investigation Status

- Investigation complete. Both reported issues appear resolved or were intermittent and could not be reproduced consistently. The underlying logic for provider loading in the reauth dialog and router redirection seems correct.
