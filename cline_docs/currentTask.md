# Current Task

## Objective

Implement swipe navigation in card details page

## Context

The card details page needed enhancement to allow users to navigate between cards without returning to the card list. This would improve the user experience by making it easier to browse through cards, especially when viewing filtered or search results.

The implementation needed to:

1. Allow swiping between cards in the card details view
2. Respect the current filtered card list (including search results and applied filters)
3. Provide intuitive navigation controls
4. Maintain the existing card details functionality
5. Work in both portrait and landscape orientations

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Implement Swipe Navigation in Card Details Page

Location: lib/features/cards/presentation/pages/card_details_page.dart

Current Issue:

- Users had to return to the card list to view different cards
- No way to navigate between cards in the details view
- Difficult to browse through filtered or search results

Solution:

1. Convert CardDetailsPage to a ConsumerStatefulWidget:
   - Changed from StatelessWidget to ConsumerStatefulWidget to manage state
   - Added state variables to track current card, index, and card list
   - Implemented PageController for handling swipe navigation

2. Fetch and maintain filtered card list:
   - Used filteredSearchNotifierProvider to get the current filtered card list
   - Found the index of the current card in the list
   - Initialized PageController to the current index

3. Implemented PageView for swiping:
   - Added PageView.builder to allow horizontal swiping between cards
   - Updated state when page changes to track current card and index
   - Maintained existing layout structure within PageView

4. Added navigation controls:
   - Created _buildNavigationOverlay method for navigation buttons
   - Positioned previous/next buttons on the sides of the card image
   - Made buttons semi-transparent to not obstruct the card image
   - Only showed previous button when not on the first card
   - Only showed next button when not on the last card

5. Updated layouts to include navigation overlay:
   - Modified _buildWideLayout to include navigation overlay
   - Ensured navigation controls work in both portrait and landscape orientations

Files Modified:

- lib/features/cards/presentation/pages/card_details_page.dart
- lib/core/routing/app_router.dart (updated to use new constructor)

Impact:

- Users can now swipe left/right to navigate between cards
- Navigation respects the current filtered card list, including search results and applied filters
- Intuitive navigation controls on the sides of the card image
- Smooth transitions between cards with animations
- Improved user experience for browsing through cards
- Seamless integration between filtering, searching, and sorting

## Current Status

- Swipe navigation has been successfully implemented in the card details page
- Users can now navigate between cards without returning to the card list
- Navigation controls are intuitive and visually appealing
- The implementation respects the current filtered card list, including search results and applied filters
- The feature works in both portrait and landscape orientations
- The navigation buttons are positioned on the sides of the card image for easy access
- Smooth transitions between cards enhance the user experience

## Testing Strategy

1. Swipe Navigation Test
   - Test swiping left and right to navigate between cards
   - Verify that the correct card is displayed after swiping
   - Check that the page controller updates the current index correctly
   - Test edge cases (first card, last card)
   - Verify that swiping respects the current filtered card list

2. Navigation Controls Test
   - Verify that previous/next buttons appear in the correct positions
   - Check that previous button is hidden on the first card
   - Check that next button is hidden on the last card
   - Test clicking the navigation buttons to move between cards
   - Verify smooth transitions when using the buttons

3. Layout Compatibility Test
   - Test in portrait orientation
   - Test in landscape orientation
   - Verify that navigation controls are properly positioned in both orientations
   - Check that the card image and details are displayed correctly

4. Integration Test
   - Apply filters and verify that swiping navigates through filtered cards
   - Search for cards and verify that swiping navigates through search results
   - Sort cards and verify that swiping respects the sort order
   - Verify that all operations work together seamlessly

## Success Criteria

- Users can swipe left/right to navigate between cards
- Navigation buttons are properly positioned and visible
- Previous button is hidden on the first card
- Next button is hidden on the last card
- Swiping respects the current filtered card list
- Navigation works in both portrait and landscape orientations
- Transitions between cards are smooth and animated
- The feature enhances the overall user experience

## Next Steps

1. Improve image loading performance
   - Optimize image caching for faster loading
   - Reduce animation overhead for smoother transitions
   - Implement progressive image loading techniques

2. Enhance error handling for image loading
   - Provide better fallback mechanisms
   - Improve error reporting and recovery
   - Add retry functionality for failed image loads

3. Consider adding card index indicator
   - Show current position in the filtered card list (e.g., "Card 5 of 20")
   - Provide visual feedback about navigation progress
