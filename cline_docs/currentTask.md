## Latest Objective (Completed)

## Recent Objective (Completed)

Fix layout issues in the Collection UI by resolving nested scrollable widgets problem

## Theme Customization Context (Completed)

The app needed a comprehensive theming system to provide a personalized user experience and ensure good readability in both light and dark modes. We implemented a theme customization system with the following features:

1. Theme mode selection (Light, Dark, System)
2. Custom theme color selection with color picker
3. Predefined color schemes from FlexColorScheme
4. Contrast guarantees for text readability
5. Persistent theme settings across app restarts

## Collection Management Context (Completed)

The app needed a comprehensive collection management system to allow users to track their card collection, including quantities, conditions, purchase information, and professional grading. We implemented a collection management system with the following features:

1. Collection tracking for regular and foil cards
2. Card condition tracking with standardized condition codes (NM, LP, MP, HP, DMG)
3. Purchase information tracking with price and date
4. Professional grading support for PSA, BGS, and CGC
5. Collection statistics
6. Grid and list view options with customizable sizes
7. Filtering by card type (regular, foil, graded)
8. Sorting by various criteria (last modified, card ID, quantity)
9. Search functionality within collection

## Card Details and Collection Workflow Enhancement Context (Completed)

The app needed a more streamlined workflow for adding cards to the collection and better integration between the card details page and collection management. We implemented the following enhancements:

1. Action buttons on the card details page (Add to Collection, Favorite, Add to Wishlist)
2. Integrated card search in the collection edit page
3. Direct navigation from card details to collection edit
4. Placeholder functionality for favorites and wishlist features

## Collection UI Improvement Context (Completed)

The Collection UI needed to be more consistent with the Cards UI for a better user experience. We implemented the following improvements:

1. Updated collection grid to match cards grid implementation
2. Added card labels toggle in collection page
3. Improved collection card display with quantity indicators
4. Enhanced collection search functionality to search by card name
5. Fixed scrolling issues in collection content
6. Added scroll to top functionality
7. Improved sort options with animation and visual feedback
8. Added price sorting options (market, low, mid, high)
9. Fixed search functionality in collection edit page
10. Ensured consistent UI between cards and collection features

## Collection UI Layout Fix Context (Completed)

The Collection UI had layout issues due to nested scrollable widgets, causing "Vertical viewport was given unbounded height" errors and preventing cards from displaying. We implemented the following fixes:

1. Removed nested scrollable widgets in collection content
2. Changed CollectionGrid to use a non-scrollable GridView with shrinkWrap and NeverScrollableScrollPhysics
3. Updated CollectionList to use a non-scrollable ListView with shrinkWrap and NeverScrollableScrollPhysics
4. Simplified CollectionContent to properly handle the view type without passing scrollController to child widgets
5. Removed unused _scrollToTop method from CollectionPage
6. Replaced deprecated withOpacity with withAlpha for better performance
