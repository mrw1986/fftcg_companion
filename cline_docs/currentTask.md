# Current Task

## Objective

Improve app initialization, loading states, and splash screen implementation

## Context

The app was experiencing issues with:

1. Provider initialization conflicts during startup
2. Complex loading screen implementation
3. Lack of a proper splash screen
4. Need for a simpler loading indicator

## Changes Made

### Loading and Initialization

- Removed LoadingWrapper in favor of page-level loading states
- Created a simplified LoadingIndicator widget
- Added flutter_native_splash for better app launch experience
- Fixed provider initialization conflicts

### Code Organization

- Created shared/widgets/loading_indicator.dart for reusable loading UI
- Updated cards_page.dart to handle loading states directly
- Improved state management with Riverpod
- Simplified CardRepository initialization flow

### UI/UX Improvements

- Added branded splash screen with app logo
- Implemented consistent loading indicator across the app
- Improved error handling during initialization
- Enhanced loading state transitions

## Current Status

- [x] Fixed provider initialization conflicts
- [x] Implemented native splash screen
- [x] Created simplified loading indicator
- [x] Updated documentation
- [x] Improved initialization flow
- [x] Enhanced loading state management
- [x] Optimized caching with version tracking
- [x] Improved logging system
- [x] Enhanced image loading performance
- [x] Fixed code quality issues

## Next Steps

1. Monitor app initialization performance
2. Consider adding loading progress indicators where appropriate
3. Add unit tests for initialization logic
4. Consider additional caching optimizations
5. Monitor logging performance in production
6. Consider implementing lazy image loading for off-screen cards
