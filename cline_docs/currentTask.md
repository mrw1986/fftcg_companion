Fix email verification and account deletion UX issues

### Issue Context

The app had several UX issues with email verification and account deletion:

1. Email verification state wasn't updating without app restart
2. Account deletion UI needed improvement with proper confirmation dialogs
3. Re-authentication flow needed better error handling

### Implementation Plan

#### 1. Email Verification Improvements

- Enhanced email verification checker to properly detect verification
- Added proper UI refresh after verification
- Improved token refresh handling in auth service
- Added better error handling and user feedback

#### 2. Account Deletion UI Enhancement

- Implemented proper confirmation dialog for account deletion
- Moved delete confirmation from inline to popup dialog
- Added clear warning messages about data loss
- Improved error handling with user-friendly dialogs

#### 3. Re-authentication Flow

- Enhanced re-authentication dialog UI
- Added better error messages for auth failures
- Improved state management during re-authentication
- Added proper cleanup after operations

### Implementation Status

#### Completed Tasks

- Email verification checker now properly updates UI:
  - Enhanced token refresh mechanism and ensured it's called after email updates
  - Improved UI update after verification
  - Added more robust error handling and logging
- Account deletion improvements:
  - Added popup confirmation dialog
  - Fixed error handling for requires-recent-login cases
  - Added user-friendly error messages
  - Improved detection of re-authentication requirements from generic exceptions
  - Added dedicated re-authentication dialog with clear explanation
- Re-authentication flow improvements:
  - Fixed re-authentication prompt for account deletion and email updates
  - Added proper state management for re-auth dialog
  - Improved error handling with clear messages
  - Added proper cleanup after operations
  - Enhanced re-authentication dialog to be context-aware (deletion vs. email update)
  - Added automatic continuation of operation after successful re-authentication
  - Fixed issue where `requires-recent-login` error was not correctly handled for email updates
- Auth service properly handles token refreshes
- Fixed issue where updated email address was not reflected in the UI after verification:
  - Added `updateUserEmail` method to `UserRepository` to update the email in Firestore.
  - Called `updateUserEmail` in `AuthService.verifyBeforeUpdateEmail` after successful verification.
- Fixed multiple UI refreshes after email verification by removing redundant navigation calls in `email_verification_checker.dart`.
- Refactored profile page into smaller components for better maintainability:
  - Created `ProfileAuthSection` for authentication-related UI
  - Created `ProfileAccountInformation` for displaying account info
  - Created `ProfileSettings` for app settings
  - Created `ProfileReauthDialog` for re-authentication
  - Created `ProfileEmailUpdate` for email update functionality
  - Created `ProfileAccountActions` for account actions (sign out, delete)
  - Created `ProfileDisplayName` for display name update
  - Improved the "Change Email" flow to ensure users are properly logged out after email update
  - Added clear messaging to inform users they'll be logged out after email update
  - Ensured users are redirected to the Profile page with Sign In button after logout
- Fixed code quality issues:
  - Removed unused imports from profile-related components
  - Removed unused variables from profile components
  - Improved code organization and readability

#### Testing Strategy

1. Email Verification Test
   - Verify that UI updates after email verification
   - Test error handling for verification failures
   - Verify that auth state updates properly

2. Account Deletion Test
   - Test confirmation dialog appearance and behavior
   - Verify proper error handling:
     - Test requires-recent-login detection
     - Verify user-friendly error messages
     - Test error handling during re-auth
   - Test re-authentication flow:
     - Verify re-auth dialog shows when needed
     - Test successful re-auth leads to deletion
     - Verify proper state cleanup
   - Verify cleanup after operations

3. Re-authentication Test
   - Test dialog appearance and behavior
   - Verify error message clarity
   - Test state management during operations
   - Verify proper error handling for:
     - Invalid credentials
     - Network errors
     - Unexpected errors

4. Email Update Test
   - Test email update flow with proper logout
   - Verify user is informed about logout requirement
   - Confirm user is redirected to Profile page after logout
   - Test re-authentication when needed for email update

## Current Objective 12 (Completed)

Consolidate Profile and Account Settings pages

### Settings Pages Context

The app had separate Profile and Account Settings pages with redundant functionality. This created a confusing user experience and required users to navigate between two similar pages.

### Settings Pages Implementation

1. Consolidate the UI of the Profile and Account Settings pages
2. Maintain all functionality in a single Profile page
3. Update navigation to remove the separate Account Settings page
4. Ensure a seamless UX with a UI that matches the rest of the app

### Settings Pages Results

- Consolidated the Profile and Account Settings pages:
  - Combined all account management functionality into the Profile page
  - Removed redundant UI elements
  - Maintained all existing functionality
  - Improved the user experience by having all settings in one place
- Updated the router to remove the separate account page route
- Removed navigation to the account page from the profile auth section
- Fixed any related issues to ensure a seamless experience

## Current Objective 13 (Completed)

UI Cleanup for Profile Page

### UI Cleanup Context

The Profile page contained UI elements that were no longer needed or were causing confusion for users.

### UI Cleanup Implementation

1. Remove the "Continue with Google" button from the Profile page
2. Remove the "Show Splash Screen" toggle from the Profile Settings

### UI Cleanup Results

- Removed the "Continue with Google" button from the Profile page:
  - Simplified the UI for anonymous users
  - Reduced redundancy as users can still sign in with Google from the login page
- Removed the "Show Splash Screen" toggle from the Profile Settings:
  - Simplified the settings UI
  - Removed a setting that was not essential for the user experience

## Next Steps

1. Implement deck builder feature
2. Implement card scanner feature
3. Implement price tracking feature
4. Add collection import/export functionality
5. Add collection sharing functionality
6. Implement favorites and wishlist features
7. Add advanced filtering options for collection
8. Implement batch operations for collection management
