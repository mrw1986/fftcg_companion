Fix email verification and account deletion UX issues

### Context

The app had several UX issues with email verification and account deletion:

1. Email verification state wasn't updating without app restart
2. Account deletion UI needed improvement with proper confirmation dialogs
3. Re-authentication flow needed better error handling

### Implementation Plan

#### 1. Email Verification Improvements

- Enhanced email verification checker to properly detect verification
- Added proper UI refresh after verification
- Improved token refresh handling in auth service
- Added better error handling and user feedback

#### 2. Account Deletion UI Enhancement

- Implemented proper confirmation dialog for account deletion
- Moved delete confirmation from inline to popup dialog
- Added clear warning messages about data loss
- Improved error handling with user-friendly dialogs

#### 3. Re-authentication Flow

- Enhanced re-authentication dialog UI
- Added better error messages for auth failures
- Improved state management during re-authentication
- Added proper cleanup after operations

### Status

#### Completed

- Email verification checker now properly updates UI:
  - Enhanced token refresh mechanism
  - Improved UI update after verification
  - Added more robust error handling and logging
- Account deletion improvements:
  - Added popup confirmation dialog
  - Fixed error handling for requires-recent-login cases
  - Added user-friendly error messages
  - Improved detection of re-authentication requirements from generic exceptions
  - Added dedicated re-authentication dialog with clear explanation
- Re-authentication flow improvements:
  - Fixed re-authentication prompt for account deletion
  - Added proper state management for re-auth dialog
  - Improved error handling with clear messages
  - Added proper cleanup after operations
  - Enhanced re-authentication dialog to be context-aware (deletion vs. email update)
  - Added automatic continuation of operation after successful re-authentication
- Auth service properly handles token refreshes

#### Testing Strategy

1. Email Verification Test
   - Verify that UI updates after email verification
   - Test error handling for verification failures
   - Verify that auth state updates properly

2. Account Deletion Test
   - Test confirmation dialog appearance and behavior
   - Verify proper error handling:
     - Test requires-recent-login detection
     - Verify user-friendly error messages
     - Test error handling during re-auth
   - Test re-authentication flow:
     - Verify re-auth dialog shows when needed
     - Test successful re-auth leads to deletion
     - Verify proper state cleanup
   - Verify cleanup after operations

3. Re-authentication Test
   - Test dialog appearance and behavior
   - Verify error message clarity
   - Test state management during operations
   - Verify proper error handling for:
     - Invalid credentials
     - Network errors
     - Unexpected errors

### Next Steps

1. Implement deck builder feature
2. Implement card scanner feature
3. Implement price tracking feature
4. Add collection import/export functionality
