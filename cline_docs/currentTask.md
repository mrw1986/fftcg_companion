# Current Task

## Objective

Fix search functionality issues in the app

## Context

The search functionality in the app was not working correctly:

1. When typing a search term and then modifying it (e.g., typing "s", then "se", then back to "s"), the search results were not updating properly
2. The search results were not being sorted correctly, particularly for single-letter searches
3. The caching mechanism was causing stale results to be displayed

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Rewrite CardSearchNotifier for Better State Management

Location: lib/features/cards/presentation/providers/cards_provider.dart

Current Issue:

- The debouncing and caching mechanisms were interfering with each other
- State was not being properly updated when the search query changed
- Progressive searches were not working correctly

Solution:

- Completely rewrote the CardSearchNotifier class
- Simplified the search implementation
- Added code to clear the search cache when the query changes
- Maintained a minimal debounce timer to prevent excessive searches during typing

Impact:

- Search results now update correctly when the search query changes
- The UI is more responsive during typing
- No more stale results from previous searches

### 2. Add clearSearchCache Method to CardCache

Location: lib/core/storage/card_cache.dart

Current Issue:

- There was no way to clear the search cache when needed
- This was causing stale results to be displayed

Solution:

- Added a clearSearchCache method to the CardCache class
- This method clears both memory and disk search caches
- Called this method when the search query changes

Impact:

- Each search query now gets fresh results
- The search cache is properly cleared when needed
- No more stale results from previous searches

### 3. Improve Sorting Logic for Search Results

Location: lib/features/cards/data/repositories/card_repository.dart

Current Issue:

- When searching for "s", SOLDIER was appearing before Sabin
- The sorting logic wasn't properly prioritizing alphabetical order for cards with the same relevance score

Solution:

- Modified the relevance calculation and sorting logic
- Improved the sorting logic to properly handle alphabetical sorting for cards with the same relevance score
- Enhanced the name comparison logic for single-letter searches

Impact:

- Search results are now sorted correctly
- For single-letter searches, cards are sorted alphabetically
- The search results are more intuitive and consistent

## Testing Strategy

1. Progressive Search Testing
   - Type a search term (e.g., "s")
   - Modify the search term (e.g., "se")
   - Go back to the original search term (e.g., "s")
   - Verify that the search results update correctly

2. Sorting Testing
   - Search for a single letter (e.g., "s")
   - Verify that the results are sorted alphabetically
   - Check that cards starting with that letter appear before cards containing that letter

3. Cache Invalidation Testing
   - Perform multiple searches
   - Verify that each search gets fresh results
   - Check that there are no stale results from previous searches

## Success Criteria

- Search results update correctly when the search query changes
- Search results are sorted correctly, particularly for single-letter searches
- No stale results from previous searches
- The UI is responsive during typing
- The search functionality works as expected for all search patterns

## Next Steps

1. Consider implementing a more sophisticated relevance calculation for search results
2. Explore further optimizations for the search process
3. Add analytics to track search performance and usage
4. Implement more comprehensive testing for the search functionality
