# Current Task

## Objective

Monitor and optimize text processing and filtering system performance

## Context

Recent improvements have been implemented:

1. Case-insensitive EX BURST processing ✓
2. Enhanced HTML tag support ✓
3. Fixed card name reference preservation ✓
4. Improved special ability formatting ✓
5. Optimized filter collection usage ✓

Now we need to monitor performance and make further optimizations.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Text Processing Performance Monitoring

- Location: lib/features/cards/presentation/widgets/card_description_text.dart
- Current: New text processing system implemented
- Next Steps:
  - Add performance metrics
  - Monitor memory usage
  - Track render times
  - Identify optimization opportunities
- Impact: Better understanding of text processing overhead

### 2. Filter System Performance Analysis

- Location: Multiple files
  - lib/features/cards/presentation/providers/filter_provider.dart
  - lib/features/cards/presentation/widgets/filter_dialog.dart
- Current: New filter collection structure implemented
- Next Steps:
  - Monitor query performance
  - Analyze filter combination efficiency
  - Track UI responsiveness
  - Measure memory impact
- Impact: Insights for further optimization

### 3. Text Caching Consideration

- Location: lib/core/storage/cache_manager.dart
- Current: No specific text processing caching
- Evaluate:
  - Processed text caching strategy
  - Memory vs performance tradeoffs
  - Cache invalidation approach
  - Storage requirements
- Impact: Potential performance improvement for frequently viewed cards

### 4. Filter Collection Optimization

- Location: Multiple files
- Current: Basic filter collection structure
- Consider:
  - Index optimization
  - Query pattern analysis
  - Cache strategy refinement
  - Memory usage optimization
- Impact: Better filtering performance

## Next Steps

1. Implement performance monitoring
2. Gather baseline metrics
3. Identify optimization targets
4. Plan caching strategy
5. Consider additional optimizations
