# Current Task

## Objective

Implement Firebase Authentication in the FFTCG Companion app with automatic anonymous authentication

## Context

The app needed user authentication to maintain user settings, collections, decks, and other user-specific data across devices. We implemented Firebase Authentication with three authentication methods:

1. Google Sign-In
2. Email/Password authentication
3. Anonymous authentication (automatic)

This implementation allows users to:

- Create accounts with email/password or Google Sign-In
- Use the app anonymously without explicitly choosing to do so (automatic)
- Upgrade from anonymous to permanent accounts without losing data
- Manage their account settings
- Sign in across multiple devices with the same account

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Create Authentication Service

Location: lib/core/services/auth_service.dart

- Created a service class to handle all Firebase Authentication operations
- Implemented methods for each authentication provider
- Added user state management and persistence
- Implemented error handling for authentication operations
- Added methods to link anonymous accounts to permanent accounts

### 2. Create Authentication Provider

Location: lib/core/providers/auth_provider.dart

- Created Riverpod providers for authentication state
- Implemented AuthState class to represent different authentication states
- Added methods to expose authentication functionality to the UI

### 3. Implement Automatic Anonymous Authentication

Location: lib/core/providers/auto_auth_provider.dart

- Created a provider that automatically signs in anonymously if the user is not already signed in
- Integrated the auto-auth provider with the app initialization
- Removed explicit "Continue without an account" buttons from the UI

### 4. Create Authentication UI

- Created login page: lib/features/profile/presentation/pages/login_page.dart
- Created registration page: lib/features/profile/presentation/pages/register_page.dart
- Created password reset page: lib/features/profile/presentation/pages/reset_password_page.dart
- Created account management page: lib/features/profile/presentation/pages/account_page.dart
- Updated profile page to show different options based on authentication state

### 5. Update Router

Location: lib/core/routing/app_router.dart

- Added routes for new authentication pages
- Updated imports to include new pages

### 6. Update Main.dart

Location: lib/main.dart

- Added Firebase Authentication import
- Ensured Firebase is properly initialized

### 7. Fix Account Linking Issues

- Modified login flow to check if the user is anonymous before signing in
- If the user is anonymous, link the new credentials to the anonymous account instead of creating a new account
- This ensures that user data from anonymous sessions is preserved when upgrading to a permanent account

## Files Modified

1. lib/core/services/auth_service.dart (new)
2. lib/core/providers/auth_provider.dart (new)
3. lib/core/providers/auto_auth_provider.dart (new)
4. lib/features/profile/presentation/pages/login_page.dart (new)
5. lib/features/profile/presentation/pages/register_page.dart (new)
6. lib/features/profile/presentation/pages/reset_password_page.dart (new)
7. lib/features/profile/presentation/pages/account_page.dart (new)
8. lib/features/profile/presentation/pages/profile_page.dart (updated)
9. lib/core/routing/app_router.dart (updated)
10. lib/main.dart (updated)
11. lib/app/app.dart (updated)

## Impact

- Users are automatically signed in anonymously when they first open the app
- Users can create accounts and sign in using multiple authentication methods
- Anonymous users can upgrade to permanent accounts without losing their data
- User data can be synchronized across devices
- The Profile page shows different options based on authentication state
- Account management features are now available

## Current Status

- Firebase Authentication has been implemented with Google Sign-In, Email/Password, and Anonymous authentication
- Automatic anonymous authentication has been implemented
- UI for authentication has been created
- Router has been updated to include new authentication routes
- Main.dart and app.dart have been updated to initialize Firebase Authentication and auto-auth
- Account linking has been fixed to preserve user data when upgrading from anonymous to permanent accounts

## Testing Strategy

1. Authentication Flow Test
   - Test each authentication provider (Google, Email/Password)
   - Verify that automatic anonymous authentication works
   - Verify user state persistence
   - Test upgrading from anonymous to permanent accounts

2. UI Test
   - Verify that the Profile page shows different options based on authentication state
   - Test login, registration, and password reset forms
   - Verify form validation works correctly

3. Error Handling Test
   - Test error handling for invalid credentials
   - Test error handling for network issues
   - Verify user feedback for errors

## Next Steps

1. Implement Firestore security rules to protect user data
2. Update collection and deck features to associate data with user accounts
3. Implement data migration when converting from anonymous to permanent accounts
4. Add user profile customization options
5. Implement email verification
