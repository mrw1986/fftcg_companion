## Current Objective 12 (Completed)

Consolidate Profile and Account Settings pages

### Settings Pages Context

The app had separate Profile and Account Settings pages with redundant functionality. This created a confusing user experience and required users to navigate between two similar pages.

### Settings Pages Implementation

1. Consolidate the UI of the Profile and Account Settings pages
2. Maintain all functionality in a single Profile page
3. Update navigation to remove the separate Account Settings page
4. Ensure a seamless UX with a UI that matches the rest of the app

### Settings Pages Results

- Consolidated the Profile and Account Settings pages:
  - Combined all account management functionality into the Profile page
  - Removed redundant UI elements
  - Maintained all existing functionality
  - Improved the user experience by having all settings in one place
- Updated the router to remove the separate account page route
- Removed navigation to the account page from the profile auth section
- Fixed any related issues to ensure a seamless experience

## Current Objective 13 (Completed)

UI Cleanup for Profile Page

### UI Cleanup Context

The Profile page contained UI elements that were no longer needed or were causing confusion for users.

### UI Cleanup Implementation

1. Remove the "Continue with Google" button from the Profile page
2. Remove the "Show Splash Screen" toggle from the Profile Settings

### UI Cleanup Results

- Removed the "Continue with Google" button from the Profile page:
  - Simplified the UI for anonymous users
  - Reduced redundancy as users can still sign in with Google from the login page
- Removed the "Show Splash Screen" toggle from the Profile Settings:
  - Simplified the settings UI
  - Removed a setting that was not essential for the user experience

## Current Objective 14 (In Progress)

Improve Authentication UI and UX

## Current Objective 15 (Completed)

   - Simplify theme handling across the application
   - Ensure consistent theming without the extension

2. Fix Profile screen redundancies:
   - Consolidate Account Information, Profile Settings, Account Security, and Account Actions
   - Improve UI layout for better user experience

### Authentication UI Implementation Plan

1. Improve the UI for unverified email accounts:
   - Show a clear warning banner with instructions
   - Add an "Unverified" label next to the email address
   - Limit functionality until email is verified
   - Provide a clear way to resend verification emails

2. Add a warning banner for anonymous accounts:
   - Inform users that anonymous data will be deleted after 30 days of inactivity
   - Provide clear options to upgrade to a permanent account
   - Maintain consistent layout with the rest of the app

### Authentication UI Implementation Status

#### Completed Tasks (Auth)

- Improved the UI for unverified email accounts:
  - Added a prominent red warning banner with clear instructions
  - Added an "Unverified" label next to the email address
  - Limited functionality until email verification is complete
  - Added a "Resend Verification Email" button with proper error handling
  - Simplified the UI to only show essential information

    - Enhanced sign-in process to force reload the user and get the latest verification status
    - Added logic to handle cases where verification status is different between Firebase Auth and Firestore
    - Improved verification detection to work in these scenarios:
      - When a user verifies their email and then logs in
      - When a user is already logged in and verifies their email (using the periodic checker)
      - When a user's email is verified in Firestore but not in Firebase Auth
      - When a user's email is verified in Firebase Auth but not in Firestore
  - Improved dialog visibility and accessibility:
    - Enhanced all confirmation dialogs to adapt to both light and dark themes

    - Ensured the verification checker runs and detects email verification while the app is active
    - This allows the app to automatically update the UI when a user verifies their email without requiring a restart
  - Added account linking functionality:
    - Added a new "Account Security" section for users with only one authentication provider
    - Implemented the ability to link a Google account to an existing email/password account
    - Improved UI to show the current provider and options to link additional providers
    - This enhances account security by providing alternative sign-in methods
    - Ensured verification status is properly synchronized between Firebase Auth and Firestore
