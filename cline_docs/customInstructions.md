- Intuitive and beautiful design

Adapt your approach based on project needs and user preferences, always aiming to guide users in efficiently creating functional applications.

## Critical Documentation and Workflow

### Documentation Management

Maintain a 'cline_docs' folder in the root directory (create if it doesn't exist) with the following essential files:

1. projectRoadmap.md
   - Purpose: High-level goals, features, completion criteria, and progress tracker
   - Update: When high-level goals change or tasks are completed
   - Include: A "completed tasks" section to maintain progress history
   - Format: Use headers (##) for main goals, checkboxes for tasks (- [ ] / - [x])
   - Content: List high-level project goals, key features, completion criteria, and track overall progress
   - Include considerations for future scalability when relevant

2. currentTask.md
   - Purpose: Current objectives, context, and next steps. This is your primary guide.
   - Update: After completing each task or subtask
   - Relation: Should explicitly reference tasks from projectRoadmap.md
   - Format: Use headers (##) for main sections, bullet points for steps or details
   - Content: Include current objectives, relevant context, and clear next steps

3. techStack.md
   - Purpose: Key technology choices and architecture decisions
   - Update: When significant technology decisions are made or changed
   - Format: Use headers (##) for main technology categories, bullet points for specifics
   - Content: Detail chosen technologies, frameworks, and architectural decisions with brief justifications

4. codebaseSummary.md
   - Purpose: Concise overview of project structure and recent changes
   - Update: When significant changes affect the overall structure
   - Include sections on:
     - Key Components and Their Interactions
     - Data Flow
     - External Dependencies (including detailed management of libraries, APIs, etc.)
     - Recent Significant Changes
     - User Feedback Integration and Its Impact on Development
   - Format: Use headers (##) for main sections, subheaders (###) for components, bullet points for details
   - Content: Provide a high-level overview of the project structure, highlighting main components and their relationships

### Additional Documentation

- Create reference documents for future developers as needed, storing them in the cline_docs folder
- Examples include styleAesthetic.md or wireframes.md
- Note these additional documents in codebaseSummary.md for easy reference

### Markdown Formatting Guidelines

- Follow standard markdown lint rules to ensure consistent formatting:
  - MD022: Ensure headings are surrounded by blank lines (both above and below)
  - MD024: Ensure all headings are unique within a document
    - For similar sections across different objectives, add a prefix or suffix to make headings unique
    - Example: "### Context for Feature A" and "### Context for Feature B" instead of two "### Context" headings
  - MD031: Ensure fenced code blocks are surrounded by blank lines
  - MD032: Ensure lists are surrounded by blank lines
  - MD047: Ensure files end with a single newline character

- Use proper heading hierarchy (MD001):
  - Start with H1 (#) for document title
  - Use H2 (##) for main sections
  - Use H3 (###) for subsections
  - Use H4 (####) for further divisions

- Use consistent list formatting:
  - Use hyphens (-) for unordered lists
  - Use numbers (1., 2., etc.) for ordered lists
  - Maintain consistent indentation for nested lists (2 spaces)

- Separate sections with a blank line for readability

- Use code blocks with language specification for code snippets:

```dart
// Example Dart code
void main() {
  print('Hello, world!');
}
```

- Use inline code formatting for variable names, function names, and other code references

### Adaptive Workflow

- At the beginning of every task when instructed to "follow your custom instructions", read the essential documents in this order:
  1. projectRoadmap.md (for high-level context and goals)
  2. currentTask.md (for specific current objectives)
  3. techStack.md
  4. codebaseSummary.md

- If you try to read or edit another document before reading these, something BAD will happen.

- Update documents based on significant changes, not minor steps

- If conflicting information is found between documents, ask the user for clarification

- Create files in the userInstructions folder for tasks that require user action:
  - Provide detailed, step-by-step instructions
  - Include all necessary details for ease of use
  - No need for a formal structure, but ensure clarity and completeness
  - Use numbered lists for sequential steps, code blocks for commands or code snippets

- Prioritize frequent testing: Run servers and test functionality regularly throughout development, rather than building extensive features before testing

## FFTCG Companion App Specifics

### Project Structure

- Follow the established feature-first architecture:
  - Core functionality in `/lib/core/`
  - Feature modules in `/lib/features/`
  - Shared components in `/lib/shared/`
  - App configuration in `/lib/app/`

- Maintain separation of concerns within feature modules:
  - Data layer (repositories, data sources)
  - Domain layer (models, entities)
  - Presentation layer (pages, widgets, providers)

- Use consistent naming conventions:
  - Feature-specific files should be prefixed with the feature name (e.g., `profile_page.dart`)
  - Provider files should use the suffix `_provider.dart`
  - Repository files should use the suffix `_repository.dart`

### State Management

- Use Riverpod for state management and dependency injection:
  - AsyncNotifierProvider for async operations
  - StateNotifierProvider for mutable state
  - Provider for dependency injection
  - ConsumerWidget for reactive UI updates

- Follow established patterns for state management:
  - Keep providers focused on a single responsibility
  - Use proper error handling in async providers
  - Implement proper loading states

### UI/UX Guidelines

- Maintain consistency with the existing UI:
  - Use the app's color scheme and contrast extensions
  - Follow the established component styling
  - Ensure proper spacing and padding

- Implement responsive layouts:
  - Use flexible widgets that adapt to different screen sizes
  - Test on both phone and tablet form factors

- Ensure accessibility:
  - Use semantic labels for important UI elements
  - Maintain sufficient contrast ratios
  - Support screen readers

### Firebase Integration

- Follow established patterns for Firebase integration:
  - Use the auth service for authentication operations
  - Implement proper error handling for Firebase operations
  - Follow the repository pattern for Firestore access
  - Ensure offline support where appropriate

- Maintain security:
  - Never expose Firebase API keys or secrets
  - Follow the principle of least privilege
  - Validate user input before sending to Firebase

## User Interaction and Adaptive Behavior

- Ask follow-up questions when critical information is missing for task completion

- Adjust approach based on project complexity and user preferences

- Strive for efficient task completion with minimal back-and-forth

- Present key technical decisions concisely, allowing for user feedback

- Utilize the MCP servers/tools when needing to reference documentation in regards to Flutter, Firebase, Riverpod, and Flutter packages

## Code Editing and File Operations

- Organize new projects efficiently, considering project type and dependencies

- Refer to the main Cline system for specific file handling instructions

Remember, your goal is to guide users in creating functional applications efficiently while maintaining comprehensive project documentation.
