# WorkflowDetails

## Development Workflow

### Setup
1. Install Flutter SDK and required tools
2. Clone repository
3. Run `flutter pub get`
4. Configure Firebase project
5. Set up development environment (Android Studio/VSCode)

### Development Process
1. **Code Generation**
   ```bash
   flutter pub run build_runner build
   ```
   - Run after modifying models
   - Required for Freezed and JSON serialization

2. **Local Development**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
   - Hot reload available for quick iterations
   - Test on both iOS and Android simulators

3. **State Management**
   - Use Riverpod providers for state
   - Follow existing patterns in feature directories
   - Implement proper error handling

### Testing
1. **Unit Tests**
   ```bash
   flutter test
   ```
   - Focus on business logic
   - Test repository implementations

2. **Integration Tests**
   ```bash
   flutter drive
   ```
   - Test critical user flows
   - Verify Firebase integration

## Deployment Process

### Android
1. Update version in `pubspec.yaml`
2. Build release APK:
   ```bash
   flutter build apk --release
   ```
3. Test release build
4. Deploy to Play Store

### iOS
1. Update version in `pubspec.yaml`
2. Build release IPA:
   ```bash
   flutter build ios --release
   ```
3. Archive in Xcode
4. Submit to App Store

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Update Flutter SDK and dependencies
- Monitor Firebase usage and quotas
- Backup Firestore data
- Review crash reports

### Database Management
- Regular data validation
- Index optimization
- Cache strategy updates

### Performance Monitoring
- Track app performance metrics
- Monitor network requests
- Analyze user behavior

## Best Practices

### Code Quality
- Follow Flutter style guide
- Use static analysis tools
- Regular code reviews
- Document complex logic

### Version Control
- Feature branches for development
- Meaningful commit messages
- Regular merges with main branch
- Tag releases

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. Build failures
   - Clean build: `flutter clean`
   - Regenerate files: `flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`

2. Firebase issues
   - Verify configuration files
   - Check authentication setup
   - Monitor quota usage

3. State management
   - Clear app data for fresh start
   - Check provider dependencies
   - Verify data flow

## Actionable Advice
- Always test on both platforms before deployment
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Monitor app performance regularly
- Maintain comprehensive documentation
- Follow established coding patterns
- Regular backups of critical data
